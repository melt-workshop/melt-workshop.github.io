### Workshop Track

We welcome submissions of **novel, unpublished work**. We solicit **extended abstracts (up to 2 pages), short papers (up to 5 pages), and long papers (up to 9 pages)**; all are **non-archival**, with unlimited space for references and appendices. Submissions must include a statement addressing broader impacts and ethical considerations of their work, in line with COLM Code of Ethics, outside the page limit.
All submissions should use the [official COLM LaTeX style template](https://github.com/COLM-org/Template/archive/refs/tags/2025.zip) and follow the [COLM submission guidelines](https://colmweb.org/cfp.html).

We will manage submissions through OpenReview. All papers will undergo a double-blind review process, and the final acceptance decisions will be made by the workshop organizers. The important dates are as follows:

* **Paper submission deadline:** ~~June 23, 2025 AoE~~ June 30, 2025 AoE
* **Notification of acceptance:** ~~July 21, 2025 AoE~~ August 1, 2025 AoE

### Conference Track

We also welcome **submissions that have been accepted to other journals/conferences within a year** (e.g., accepted to COLM 2025) and are aligned with the themes of this workshop. These submissions will not be subject to a review process in this workshop. Instead, they will undergo a light-touch screening to ensure thematic relevance. Authors may submit the camera-ready version of their accepted paper (up to 9 pages, no anonymization required). The important dates are as follows:  

* **Paper submission deadline:** ~~July 14, 2025 AoE~~  July 24, 2025 AoE
* **Notification of acceptance:** ~~July 21, 2025 AoE~~ August 1, 2025 AoE
