**Title:** Meta-Cultural Competence: What LLMs Should Know About Culture to Serve the Next Billion Users

**Abstract:** Anthropologist Dan Sperber once remarked that “culture is the precipitate of cognition and communication within a human population.” Culture, in this sense, both shapes and is shaped by the flow of conversation. For conversational AI systems to truly engage users meaningfully, they must be capable of interpreting the user's perspective—something that inherently involves cultural understanding.

Yet culture is notoriously hard to pin down: it resists fixed definitions and defies any quantification. In this talk, I propose a  computational framework for meta-cultural competence —one that treats cultural knowledge not as static content but as a dynamic prior. This prior informs conversational interpretation and generation, while being continuously refined through mechanisms of explication (surfacing implicit norms or values) and negotiation (adapting meaning in interaction). The goal is to move toward systems that are not just culturally sensitive, but culturally responsive—capable of evolving alongside the user’s own communicative context.

**Bio:** Monojit Choudhury is a professor of Natural Language Processing at Mohommed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI), Abu Dhabi. Prior to this, he was a principal scientist at Microsoft Research India and Microsoft Turing. Prof Choudhury's research interests lie in the intersection of NLP, Social and Cultural aspects of Technology use, and Ethics. In particular, he has been working on multilingual and multicultural aspects of large language models (LLMs), their use in low resource languages and making LLMs more inclusive and safer. Prof Choudhury takes a keen interest in popularizing linguistics and AI through puzzle solving; he is the general chair of Indian national linguistics Olympiad, the founding co-chair of Asia-Pacific linguistics Olympiad, and a founding board-member of International AI Olympiad. He holds a BTech and PhD degree in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Kharagpur.
